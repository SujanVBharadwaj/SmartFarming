 AI-Powered Smart Farming Assistant
This project is an intelligent farming assistant that leverages AI to help farmers improve crop yield based on real-time soil data. It uses a local database (SQLite) to store soil information such as moisture, pH, soil type, crop type, and location. These inputs are then processed using the LLaMA 3 large language model via Ollama, which analyzes the data and provides personalized yield improvement suggestions.

A Streamlit-based UI allows users to:

Add and view soil data entries

Generate AI recommendations

Store and review predictions

This system empowers data-driven decision-making for sustainable and efficient agriculture. ðŸŒ±ðŸ¤–
